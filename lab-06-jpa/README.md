# Lab 06 - Shopping List JPA

With our new persistence capability we can finally provide a real implementation for our Shopping List API.

## JPA Entities

Create the Cocktail and ShoppingList JPA entities to accomplish interacting with the database schema we created in the previous lab.

A partial example for the CocktailEntity:

```
@Entity
@Table(name = "cocktail")
public class CocktailEntity
```

IMPORTANT: We're going to store the CocktailEntity ingredients as a delimited String in the ingredients table column. To easily accomplish this we can use a custom JPA converter, you can add this one to your project.

```
@Converter
public class StringSetConverter implements AttributeConverter<Set<String>, String> {

    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Set<String> set) {
        if(!CollectionUtils.isEmpty(set)) {
            return "," + String.join(",", set) + ",";
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Set<String> convertToEntityAttribute(String joined) {
        if(joined != null) {
            String values = joined.substring(1, joined.length() - 1); //Removes leading and trailing commas
            return new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(values.split(",")));
        }
        return new HashSet<>();
    }
}
```

To instruct JPA to use this converter on your CocktailEntity:

```
@Convert(converter = StringSetConverter.class)
private Set<String> ingredients;
```

## Spring Data JPA Repositories

Add two Spring Data JPA repositories for both entities. We already added this dependency in the persistence lab. Refer to the documentation for a refresh on how to define JPA repositories:

https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.definition

## Service tier

There are multiple ways to architect the interaction of API calls with database entities. To keep things simple we're going to introduce a traditional Service layer.

A typical API call will go through Controller -> Service -> Repository

Service definition example:

```
@Service
public class ShoppingListService {

    private final ShoppingListRepository shoppingListRepository;

    public ShoppingListService(ShoppingListRepository shoppingListRepository) {
        this.shoppingListRepository = shoppingListRepository;
    }

    public ShoppingListResource create(ShoppingListResource shoppingListCreateResource) {
        ... 
    }
}
```

## Cocktail API

A very important change to our application involves the on-the-fly persisting of all Cocktails returned from the search, we don't want to store all the attributes, we just want to assign a UUID for every unique Cocktail and persist this on our database.

### Search cocktails

Refactor our current implementation, map all the returned cocktails from the CocktailDBClient using their idDrink attributes to our CocktailEntity instances, if we don't have it in our database, persist it.

There are a myriad of possibilities to implement this, focus on just getting a working example. Some inspiration of a possible implementation on a new CocktailService service layer component:

```
public List<CocktailResource> mergeCocktails(List<CocktailDBResponse.DrinkResource> drinks) {
    //Get all the idDrink attributes
    List<String> ids = drinks.stream().map(CocktailDBResponse.DrinkResource::getIdDrink).collect(Collectors.toList());

    //Get all the ones we already have from our DB, use a Map for convenient lookup
    Map<String, CocktailEntity> existingEntityMap = cocktailRepository.findByIdDrinkIn(ids).stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(CocktailEntity::getIdDrink, o -> o, (o, o2) -> o));

    //Stream over all the drinks, map them to the existing ones, persist a new one if not existing
    Map<String, CocktailEntity> allEntityMap = drinks.stream().map(drinkResource -> {
        CocktailEntity cocktailEntity = existingEntityMap.get(drinkResource.getIdDrink());
        if (cocktailEntity == null) {
            CocktailEntity newCocktailEntity = new CocktailEntity();
            newCocktailEntity.setId(UUID.randomUUID());
            newCocktailEntity.setIdDrink(drinkResource.getIdDrink());
            newCocktailEntity.setName(drinkResource.getStrDrink());
            cocktailEntity = cocktailRepository.save(newCocktailEntity);
        }
        return cocktailEntity;
    }).collect(Collectors.toMap(CocktailEntity::getIdDrink, o -> o, (o, o2) -> o));

    //Merge drinks and our entities, transform to CocktailResource instances
    return mergeAndTransform(drinks, allEntityMap);
}

private List<CocktailResource> mergeAndTransform(List<CocktailDBResponse.DrinkResource> drinks, Map<String, CocktailEntity> allEntityMap) {
    return drinks.stream().map(drinkResource -> new CocktailResource(allEntityMap.get(drinkResource.getIdDrink()).getId(), drinkResource.getStrDrink(), drinkResource.getStrGlass(),
            drinkResource.getStrInstructions(), drinkResource.getStrDrinkThumb(), getIngredients(drinkResource))).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

## Shopping List API

### Create a new Shopping List

Refactor the ShoppingListController to have an autowired reference to the ShoppingListService and invoke the appropriate service layer method. Replace the dummy response resources with the actual result of the creation.

### Add Cocktails to Shopping List

Replace the dummy resources and provide a real persisted implementation. This will include a service layer that will take care of linking cocktails with a specific shopping list.

### Get a Shopping List

Replace the dummy resources and provide a real persisted implementation.

This is also the API where most of our business value is going to happen! Implement the logic to retrieve all the Cocktails of the specific Shopping List and extract the distinct ingredients to include them in the response body.

### Get all Shopping Lists

Replace the dummy resources and provide a real persisted implementation.

## Testing

Refactor our MockMvc tests to include a mocked ShoppingListService bean and add appropriate expectations to the mocks.

Add a new ShoppingListServiceTest to to test our ShoppingListService methods, this could run as a simple Unit test without extensive Spring support. Simple Mockito mocks will do.

## Commit and tag your work

Make sure to add, commit and push all your files at least once at the end of every lab. After the lab has been completed completely please tag it with the appropriate lab number:

````
git tag -a lab06 -m "lab06"
