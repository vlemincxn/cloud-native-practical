# Lab 04 - External API Integration

It's time to gradually replace our dummy API data with the real thing, we'll start to integrate with the external API's provided by cocktaildb and mealdb:

* https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
* https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

## OpenFeign

There are dozens of frameworks and libraries that we can use to call an external http API. In our case we're going to use the OpenFeign http client:
 
 https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign
 
We make this choice mainly due to:

* Low verbosity and fast implementation
* Spring integration through Spring Cloud
* Support for common integration patterns, e.g: Circuit Breaker

## Spring Cloud

This is a good moment to introduce Spring Cloud:

https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud

Relevant for adding our OpenFeign dependency is the BOM and release trains it provides. This assures us that various Spring Cloud projects are managed through one release train.

To add this BOM we should pick a release train and define this in our pom.xml:

```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>Greenwich.RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Then we add the actual OpenFeign dependency, notice this is a Spring Cloud starter as compared to the previous Spring Boot starters, we don't have to specify the version as it is set in the BOM.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Feign CocktailDB client

Defining external APIs in feign is done in a declarative manner, now we'll define all the external calls we deem necessary.

To enable Spring to detect Feign clients we need to enable this through an annotation on our main Spring Application class:

```
@EnableFeignClients
public class ShoppingListApplication
```

### Search cocktails

Study the response of the search cocktail API:

Request:
```
GET https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita
```

Response (excerpt)
```
{
  "drinks": [
    {
      "idDrink": "13060",
      "strDrink": "Margarita",
      "strGlass": "Cocktail glass",
      "strInstructions": "Rub the rim of the glass with the lime slice to make the salt stick to it. Take care to moisten only the outer rim and sprinkle the salt on it. The salt should present to the lips of the imbiber and never mix into the cocktail. Shake the other ingredients with ice, then carefully pour into the glass.",
      "strDrinkThumb": "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/wpxpvu1439905379.jpg",
      "strIngredient1": "Tequila",
      "strIngredient2": "Triple sec",
      "strIngredient3": "Lime juice",
      "strIngredient4": "Salt",
      "strIngredient5": "",
      "strIngredient6": "",
      "strIngredient7": "",
    },
    ...
```

We need to define the response fields we need in a Java object, example (excerpt):

```
public class CocktailDBResponse {

    private List<DrinkResource> drinks;

    public List<DrinkResource> getDrinks() {
        return drinks;
    }

    public void setDrinks(List<DrinkResource> drinks) {
        this.drinks = drinks;
    }

    public static class DrinkResource {
        private String idDrink;
        private String strDrink;
        private String strGlass;
        private String strInstructions;
        private String strDrinkThumb;
        private String strIngredient1;
        private String strIngredient2;
        private String strIngredient3;
        ...
```

Example feign client implementation:

```
@Component
@FeignClient(name = "cocktailDBClient", url = "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1")
public interface CocktailDBClient {

    @GetMapping(value = "search.php")
    CocktailDBResponse searchCocktails(@RequestParam("s") String search);

}
```

### Integrate in our API

Now we can integrate this search into our API, this means replacing our dummy resources with this search call and transforming their responses into our responses.

After this implementation following example request to our API should be up and running:

Request:
```
GET localhost:8080/cocktails?search=russian
```

Response:
```
[
    {
        "addCocktailToListResource": "88e57cc2-09d2-43ab-9ff3-de14811523a1",
        "name": "Black Russian",
        "glass": "Old-fashioned glass",
        "instructions": "Pour the ingredients into an old fashioned glass filled with ice cubes. Stir gently.",
        "image": "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/2k5gbb1504367689.jpg",
        "ingredients": [
            "Coffee liqueur",
            "Vodka"
        ]
    },
    {
        "addCocktailToListResource": "a1118959-bc4b-47a5-bba5-d469f2c49d39",
        "name": "White Russian",
        "glass": "Old-fashioned glass",
        "instructions": "Pour vodka and coffee liqueur over ice cubes in an old-fashioned glass. Fill with light cream and serve.",
        "image": "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/vsrupw1472405732.jpg",
        "ingredients": [
            "Vodka",
            "Coffee liqueur",
            "Light cream"
        ]
    },
    ...
```

## Testing

Adapt our existing MockMVC test to use a mocked CocktailDBClient, configure the mock to return Cocktails that cause the same Controller response bodies as the previous dummy resources. This means our previous assertions should still pass successfully.

## Commit and tag your work

Make sure to add, commit and push all your files at least once at the end of every lab. After the lab has been completed completely please tag it with the appropriate lab number:

````
git tag -a lab04 -m "lab04"
